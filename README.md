# 📊 EDA for Animal Shelter

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on animal intake and outcome data from a shelter to uncover trends, conditions, and common attributes of the animals received and released.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

- `DataSet_Animal_Center_Intakes.csv` – Intake records (animal type, condition, intake method, etc.)
- `DataSet_Animal_Center_Outcomes.csv` – Outcome records (adoption, euthanasia, transfer, etc.)

## ✅ Key Tasks

- Cleaned data: removed duplicates, renamed columns, dropped redundant features.
- Extracted year and month from intake dates.
- Identified null values and missing entries.
- Analyzed and visualized:
  - Year-wise and month-wise intakes
  - Intake methods distribution
  - Common intake conditions
  - Types and breeds of animals
  - Most frequent animal names
  - Outcome types (adopted, returned, etc.)

## 📊 Visual Insights

- 📅 **Year & Month Trends** – Seasonal intake patterns
- 🐶 **Animal Types & Breeds** – Most common species and breeds
- 🧾 **Intake Methods** – How animals arrive at the shelter
- 🧍 **Outcome Types** – What happens to the animals after intake

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
  - `pandas` – data wrangling
  - `matplotlib` – visualizations
